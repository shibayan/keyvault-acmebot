# Configuration

Acmebot reads its settings from the `Acmebot` configuration section. In Azure App Service and Azure Functions app settings, nested settings are expressed with double underscores.

Example:

```text
Acmebot__Endpoint=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

## Required Settings

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__Endpoint` | ACME directory endpoint. |
| `Acmebot__Contacts` | ACME account contact email address, such as `admin@example.com`. Acmebot adds the `mailto:` scheme when calling the ACME API. |
| `Acmebot__VaultBaseUrl` | Key Vault URL where certificates are stored. |
| `Acmebot__Environment` | Azure cloud name. Defaults to `AzureCloud`. |

## General Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__Webhook__Endpoint` | Empty | Webhook URL for certificate operation notifications. |
| `Acmebot__Webhook__Events` | `All` | Events that send webhook notifications. Supported values are `Completed`, `Failed`, `All`, and `None`. Combine individual values with a comma. |
| `Acmebot__Webhook__PayloadType` | `Auto` | Webhook payload format. Supported values are `Auto`, `Generic`, `Teams`, and `Slack`. |
| `Acmebot__PreferredChain` | Empty | Preferred issuer chain name when the ACME CA offers alternate chains. |
| `Acmebot__PreferredProfile` | Empty | Preferred ACME profile when the CA advertises profiles. |
| `Acmebot__RenewBeforeExpiry` | `30` | Percentage of certificate lifetime remaining at which scheduled renewal runs, used when ACME renewal information is unavailable for the certificate. Valid range is 0 to 100. |
| `Acmebot__UseSystemNameServer` | `false` | Use the system DNS resolver instead of Google Public DNS for challenge verification. Enable it when the validation zone is private or outbound DNS policy requires internal resolvers. |
| `Acmebot__DnsChallengeCheckMaxAttempts` | `12` | Maximum number of attempts (including the first) when verifying that the DNS TXT challenge record has propagated (queried against the resolver `UseSystemNameServer` selects). Valid range is 1 to 60. |
| `Acmebot__DnsChallengeCheckIntervalSeconds` | `5` | Seconds to wait between DNS propagation check attempts. Increase this if DNS propagation is slow. Valid range is 1 to 300. |
| `Acmebot__OrderPollingMaxAttempts` | `12` | Maximum number of attempts (including the first) when waiting for the ACME order to become `ready` after answering the challenge, and when waiting for it to become `valid` after finalization. Valid range is 1 to 60. |
| `Acmebot__OrderPollingIntervalSeconds` | `5` | Seconds to wait between order status check attempts. Increase this if your CA is slow to process orders. Valid range is 1 to 300. |
| `Acmebot__ManagedIdentityClientId` | Empty | Client ID for the app-wide user-assigned managed identity used for Key Vault certificate operations, Key Vault keys, Azure DNS providers that do not override it, Route 53 web identity federation when `RoleArn` is set, and Google Cloud DNS workload identity federation when `KeyFile64` is empty. When empty, Acmebot uses the system-assigned managed identity. The user-assigned identity must be assigned to the Function App. |

## Azure Environments

| Value | Cloud |
| --- | --- |
| `AzureCloud` | Azure public cloud |

The selected environment controls Azure Resource Manager and identity authority hosts.

## External Account Binding

Configure these settings before the first ACME account registration when the selected CA requires EAB.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__ExternalAccountBinding__KeyId` | Empty | EAB key identifier. |
| `Acmebot__ExternalAccountBinding__HmacKey` | Empty | EAB HMAC key in base64url format. |
| `Acmebot__ExternalAccountBinding__Algorithm` | `HS256` | EAB HMAC signing algorithm. Common values are `HS256`, `HS384`, and `HS512`. |

## DNS Provider Settings

Configure one or more provider sections. Acmebot creates all providers whose option section is present.

Provider credentials are secrets. Use scoped provider tokens where possible, and consider App Service Key Vault references for secret values stored in Function App settings.

### Akamai Edge DNS

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__Akamai__Host` | Akamai EdgeGrid API host name, without `https://`. Acmebot calls `https://<host>/config-dns/v2/`. |

| `Acmebot__AzureDns__ManagedIdentityClientId` | Optional client ID for a user-assigned managed identity used for Azure DNS. When empty, Acmebot uses the app-wide managed identity from `Acmebot__ManagedIdentityClientId`, or the system-assigned managed identity if the app-wide client ID is empty. The user-assigned identity must be assigned to the Function App. |

Azure DNS uses the app-wide managed identity by default. This setting selects a provider-specific identity.

### Azure Private DNS

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__AzurePrivateDns__SubscriptionId` | Azure subscription ID containing the private DNS zones Acmebot manages. The selected identity must have private zone read and TXT record write/delete access in this subscription. |
| `Acmebot__AzurePrivateDns__ManagedIdentityClientId` | Optional client ID for a user-assigned managed identity used for Azure Private DNS. When empty, Acmebot uses the app-wide managed identity from `Acmebot__ManagedIdentityClientId`, or the system-assigned managed identity if the app-wide client ID is empty. The user-assigned identity must be assigned to the Function App. |

Azure Private DNS uses the app-wide managed identity by default. This setting selects a provider-specific identity.

### Cloudflare

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__Cloudflare__ApiToken` | Cloudflare API token sent as a bearer token. Grant `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Edit` permissions for the target zones. |

### Custom DNS

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__CustomDns__Endpoint` | Required | Base URL for the custom DNS API. The API must expose `/zones` and `/zones/{zoneId}/records/{recordName}` endpoints. |

### Gandi LiveDNS

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__GandiLiveDns__ApiKey` | Gandi LiveDNS API key sent as a bearer token to the Gandi v5 API. |

### GoDaddy

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__GoDaddy__ApiKey` | GoDaddy production API key. |
| `Acmebot__GoDaddy__ApiSecret` | GoDaddy production API secret. Acmebot sends `ApiKey:ApiSecret` with the `sso-key` authentication scheme. |

Confirm the account is entitled to GoDaddy production API access if zone listing or record updates fail despite valid credentials.

### Google Cloud DNS

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__GoogleDns__KeyFile64` | Base64-encoded Google service account key JSON. The service account must have Cloud DNS read/write permissions for the target project and zones. |

| `Acmebot__GoogleDns__PoolProvider` | Workload identity provider resource name without the leading `//iam.googleapis.com/` prefix. |
| `Acmebot__GoogleDns__ServiceAccount` | Google service account email or unique ID that Acmebot impersonates for Cloud DNS operations. |
| `Acmebot__GoogleDns__ManagedIdentityClientId` | Optional client ID for a user-assigned managed identity used to obtain the subject token for Google Cloud DNS workload identity federation. When empty, Acmebot uses the app-wide managed identity from `Acmebot__ManagedIdentityClientId`, or the system-assigned managed identity if the app-wide client ID is empty. The user-assigned identity must be assigned to the Function App. |

Acmebot uses the Google Cloud DNS read/write OAuth scope and ignores private managed zones. When `KeyFile64` is set, service account key authentication is used. Otherwise, all of `ProjectId`, `PoolProvider`, and `ServiceAccount` must be set for workload identity federation.

### IONOS DNS

### UnitedDomains

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__UnitedDomains__ApiKey` | UnitedDomains API key sent in the `X-API-Key` header. |

## Dashboard Authorization Setting

Issue, manual renewal, and revoke operations can optionally require Microsoft Entra app roles.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Acmebot__RequireAppRoles` | `false` | When `true`, issue and manual renewal operations require `Acmebot.IssueCertificate`, and revoke operations require `Acmebot.RevokeCertificate`. |

## Complete Example

```text
Acmebot__Endpoint=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
Acmebot__Contacts=admin@example.com
Acmebot__VaultBaseUrl=https://my-vault.vault.azure.net/
Acmebot__Environment=AzureCloud
Acmebot__AzureDns__SubscriptionId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
Acmebot__AzureDns__ManagedIdentityClientId=
Acmebot__RenewBeforeExpiry=30
Acmebot__Webhook__Endpoint=https://example.com/webhook
Acmebot__Webhook__PayloadType=Generic
Acmebot__Webhook__Events=Failed
```

The legacy scalar setting `Acmebot__Webhook=https://example.com/webhook` remains supported. It is equivalent to configuring `Webhook__Endpoint` with the default `Auto` payload type and `All` events.
