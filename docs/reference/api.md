---

# HTTP API

The dashboard uses these same-origin HTTP endpoints. They define the integration surface and operation lifecycle.

All endpoints expect authenticated requests. Issue, renew, and revoke operations may also require app roles when `Acmebot__RequireAppRoles=true`.

## Authentication

The v5 API is intended to be protected by App Service Authentication. For interactive use, users sign in through the dashboard. For automation, call the API with an authenticated principal that App Service Authentication can validate, typically a Microsoft Entra ID bearer token.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access-token>
Accept: application/json
```

The HTTP triggers use anonymous trigger authorization internally, but the application code rejects requests without an authenticated user. A Functions host key by itself does not satisfy the dashboard or API authentication checks.

When app role enforcement is enabled, issue and renew operations require `Acmebot.IssueCertificate`, and revoke operations require `Acmebot.RevokeCertificate`.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/certificates` | List certificates from Key Vault. |
| `POST` | `/api/certificates` | Start certificate issuance. |
| `POST` | `/api/certificates/{certificateName}/renew` | Start manual renewal. |
| `POST` | `/api/certificates/{certificateName}/revoke` | Revoke a certificate through the ACME certificate authority. |
| `GET` | `/api/dns-zones` | List DNS zones from configured providers. |
| `GET` | `/api/renewals` | List automatic renewal status for certificates. |
| `GET` | `/api/operations/{instanceId}` | Poll an issuance or renewal operation. |

## Operation Lifecycle

`POST /api/certificates` and `POST /api/certificates/{certificateName}/renew` return `202 Accepted` with a `Location` header. The header holds a path relative to the request, so resolve it against the endpoint you called. Poll that URL until it returns:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `202` | Operation is pending or running. |
| `200` | Operation completed. |
| Problem response | Operation failed. |

## Issue Certificate

```http
POST /api/certificates
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

```json
{
  "certificateName": "wildcard-example-com",
  "dnsNames": ["*.example.com"],
  "dnsProviderName": "Azure DNS",
  "keyType": "RSA",
  "keySize": 2048,
  "reuseKey": false,
  "dnsAlias": "acme-validation.example.net",
  "profile": "tlsserver",
  "tags": {
    "owner": "platform"
  }
}
```

### Request Fields

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `certificateName` | Yes | Key Vault certificate name. API clients must provide this value. It must be 1 to 127 characters and contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. |
| `dnsNames` | Yes | ASCII/punycode DNS names to include in the certificate. Omit trailing dots. Wildcards are allowed only as the leftmost label. |
| `dnsProviderName` | Yes | Provider display name, such as `Azure DNS` or `Cloudflare`. When `dnsAlias` is set, this provider must manage the DNS alias zone. |
| `keyType` | Yes | `RSA`, `RSA-HSM`, `EC`, or `EC-HSM`. The `-HSM` variants require a Premium-tier Key Vault and are only available through the API and CLI — the dashboard's Add Certificate dialog does not offer them. Certificates issued with an HSM key type still display correctly in the dashboard's list and details views. |
| `keySize` | For RSA/RSA-HSM | `2048`, `3072`, or `4096`. |
| `keyCurveName` | For EC/EC-HSM | `P-256`, `P-384`, `P-521`, or `P-256K`. |
| `reuseKey` | No | Whether Key Vault should reuse the certificate key. |
| `dnsAlias` | No | Alternate ASCII/punycode domain used for DNS-01 validation. Acmebot writes TXT records at `_acme-challenge.<dnsAlias>`, so omit the `_acme-challenge` prefix and trailing dot from this value. |
| `profile` | No | ACME profile to request for this certificate. When omitted, Acmebot uses `Acmebot__PreferredProfile` if configured. |
| `tags` | No | Custom Key Vault certificate tags. `Acmebot` is reserved. |

For delegated DNS-01 validation, set `dnsNames` to the certificate names and set `dnsAlias` to a unique record in a zone Acmebot can update. For each DNS name, create a CNAME from `_acme-challenge.<dnsName>` to `_acme-challenge.<dnsAlias>` in the authoritative DNS provider for the certificate domain.

## List Certificates

```http
GET /api/certificates
Accept: application/json
```

Returns an array of certificate objects.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "https://my-vault.vault.azure.net/certificates/wildcard-example-com/...",
    "name": "wildcard-example-com",
    "dnsNames": ["*.example.com"],
    "dnsProviderName": "Azure DNS",
    "createdOn": "2026-05-01T00:00:00+00:00",
    "expiresOn": "2026-07-30T00:00:00+00:00",
    "x509Thumbprint": "ABCDEF...",
    "keyType": "RSA",
    "keySize": 2048,
    "reuseKey": false,
    "enabled": true,
    "isIssuedByAcmebot": true,
    "isSameEndpoint": true,
    "acmeEndpoint": "acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org",
    "dnsAlias": "",
    "tags": {
      "owner": "platform"
    }
  }
]
```

## List DNS Zones

```http
GET /api/dns-zones
Accept: application/json
```

```json
[
  {
    "dnsProviderName": "Azure DNS",
    "dnsZones": [
      { "name": "example.com" }
    ]
  }
]
```

## List Renewal Status

```http
GET /api/renewals
Accept: application/json
```

Returns automatic renewal status for certificates visible to Acmebot.

```json
[
  {
    "certificateName": "wildcard-example-com",
    "status": "Scheduled",
    "statusKind": "scheduled",
    "message": "Renewal is scheduled within the certificate authority's suggested renewal window.",
    "nextCheck": "2026-06-20T00:00:00+00:00",
    "lastCheckedAt": "2026-06-19T00:00:00+00:00"
  }
]
```

## Manual Renewal

```http
POST /api/certificates/wildcard-example-com/renew
Accept: application/json
```

Returns `202 Accepted` with a `Location` header for operation polling. Renewal restores the per-certificate ACME profile saved in Acmebot metadata; certificates without one use the deployment-level `Acmebot__PreferredProfile` setting when configured.

## Revocation

```http
POST /api/certificates/wildcard-example-com/revoke
Accept: application/json
```

Revocation waits for the ACME revoke operation to complete, disables the current Key Vault certificate version, and returns `200 OK` on success.

## Errors

Validation errors return a problem response that may include field-specific errors. Orchestration failures return problem details from the failed Durable Functions instance.

Common statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `401` | Request is not authenticated. |
| `403` | User does not have the required app role. |
| `400` | Request validation failed or operation instance was not found. |
| `500` | Operation failed unexpectedly. |
