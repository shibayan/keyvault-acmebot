# Migration to .NET Isolated Model - Complete

The migration of KeyVault.Acmebot from .NET in-process model to .NET isolated model has been completed. This document provides a summary of the changes and guidance for testing and deployment.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Project structure and configuration**
   - Updated target framework to .NET 8.0
   - Added Program.cs for the isolated host
   - Updated host.json with necessary configurations
   - Added local.settings.json with isolated runtime setting

2. **Function migration**
   - All functions have been migrated to use the isolated worker model
   - Replaced `[FunctionName]` with `[Function]` attributes
   - Updated HTTP triggers to use `HttpRequestData` and `HttpResponseData`
   - Updated Durable Functions to use the isolated model equivalents
   - Added proper dependency injection with constructor-based logging

3. **Helper classes**
   - Added HttpRequestDataExtensions for authentication
   - Added StaticFileHelper for serving static content

## Testing the Migration

Testing scripts have been added to verify the migrated application:

1. **PowerShell integration test**: `tests/integration-test.ps1`
2. **Bash deployment verification**: `tests/deployment-verification.sh`

These scripts test all critical endpoints and functionality to ensure the application works correctly after migration.

### Local Testing

1. Run the app locally:
```
cd KeyVault.Acmebot
func start
```

2. Use the verification scripts to test the application

### Azure Testing

1. Deploy to a staging slot
2. Run the verification scripts against the staging environment
3. Verify logs in Application Insights
4. Conduct manual testing of critical paths

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Staging Deployment**

   Deploy to a staging slot first to validate the migrated application:

   ```bash
   az functionapp deployment slot create --name YourFunctionAppName --resource-group YourResourceGroup --slot staging
   func azure functionapp publish YourFunctionAppName --slot staging
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**

   Ensure the staging slot has the correct settings:

   ```bash
   az functionapp config appsettings set --name YourFunctionAppName --resource-group YourResourceGroup --slot staging --settings FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME=dotnet-isolated
   ```

3. **Verification**

   Run the verification scripts against the staging environment:

   ```bash
   BASE_URL=https://yourapp-staging.azurewebsites.net API_KEY=your-function-key ./tests/deployment-verification.sh
   ```

4. **Production Deployment**

   After successful verification, swap the staging slot with production:

   ```bash
   az functionapp deployment slot swap --name YourFunctionAppName --resource-group YourResourceGroup --slot staging --target-slot production
   ```

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Swap back to the previous production slot
   ```bash
   az functionapp deployment slot swap --name YourFunctionAppName --resource-group YourResourceGroup --slot staging --target-slot production
   ```

2. **Revert Code Changes**: If needed, revert to the pre-migration commit and redeploy

## Benefits of the Isolated Model

The migration provides several benefits:

1. **Process isolation**: The function app runs in a separate process from the Azure Functions host
2. **Latest .NET version**: Upgraded to .NET 8.0
3. **Improved performance**: Better startup time and throughput
4. **Future compatibility**: Better aligned with Microsoft's Functions roadmap

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application in production
2. Update documentation to reflect the new deployment model
3. Consider implementing more comprehensive automated tests
4. Explore new features available in the isolated model and .NET 8
