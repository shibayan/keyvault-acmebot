# Instructions for Pushing Changes to GitHub

Since this CLI environment doesn't have GitHub credentials configured, you'll need to push the changes yourself. Here are the instructions:

## Option 1: Push from the Command Line

1. Open a terminal in the repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Acme-Cert-Bot
   ```

2. Push to the master branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password/personal access token.

   Note: GitHub no longer accepts password authentication for git operations. You'll need to use a personal access token.

## Option 2: Use GitHub Desktop or Another Git Client

1. Open GitHub Desktop or your preferred Git client
2. Open the repository
3. The client should show the new commits
4. Push the changes to origin/master

## Option 3: Configure Git Credential Storage

If you plan to use this environment regularly:

1. Set up credential storage:
   ```bash
   git config --global credential.helper store
   ```

2. Try pushing again (you'll be prompted for credentials once):
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

3. Your credentials will be stored for future use

## Verifying the Push

After pushing, verify the changes appear in the GitHub repository:

1. Visit https://github.com/Hammond-Pole/keyvault-acmebot
2. Check that the latest commits are visible
3. Verify the migration files appear in the repository

## Note on Security

If you're using a shared or public machine, avoid storing credentials. Instead:

1. Use the `--global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'` option to cache credentials temporarily
2. Use SSH keys instead of HTTPS for authentication
3. Use a personal access token with limited scope and expiration
